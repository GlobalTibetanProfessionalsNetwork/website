    "text": "Connect and contribute to the community\nDue to lack of a proper channel of communication, many Tibetan professionals wishing to contribute to the community do not know where to begin. GTPN can connect them to the community as well as support their involvement in community development.\nOne of the specific ways in which the professionals can help the community is by mentoring younger Tibetans interested in similar career lines. Mentoring can happen one on one and also through meetings and workshops.\nGTPN can also establish links with the Central Tibetan Administration in Dharamshala as well as other Tibetan institutes and schools to explore other ways of contributing to the community"
