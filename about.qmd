Global Tibetan Professionals Network (GTPN) is a platform where Tibetan professionals from diverse backgrounds can network with each other and find creative ways of contributing to the community.  Through this network, Tibetan professionals around the world can share ideas, information and resources among themselves and with those aspiring to become like them through mentorship.

Launched on Nov 1, 2008 with support from Bureau of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, New Delhi, today GTPN has five active chapters: GTPN Delhi, Bangalore, Toronto, New York and London. There are currently 411 registered GTPN members.
